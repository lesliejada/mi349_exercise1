        <p> Greetings! My name is Jada Leslie and I am a 22 year old super senior at THE Michigan State University. I study media and information and my graduation date is fast approaching. I am a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. I love to read and do hot yoga. My roommates are my best friends and when I'm not doing something for the sorority or spending time with my friends, I spend the rest of my time on social media. </p>
		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JadaMariaaa">Twitter</a> is my favorite social media outlet.</p> Follow me or just take a look inside the mind of a soon to be graduate who doesn't know what's coming next in her life. 
		<p> Ciao! </p>
